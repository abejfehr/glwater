GLWater
=======

This is my project submission for the term project of COMP 3303: Computer Graphics.

Our requirement is to explore a new concept and combine it with techniques that we were taught in class to create something new.

This project makes an attempt to accurately simulate a surface of standing water, including the ripples, reflections and other various phenomena.

This project also runs as a screensaver on both Mac OS X and Windows.
